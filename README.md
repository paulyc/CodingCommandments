## Book of Genesis Block
### Chapter 1
```
1 In the Beginning, God created the Chips and the Busses.
2 And the Chips were without energy, and their Software void.
3 Then God said, "Let There Be Radio Frequency EM waves!"
4 And there were radio frequency EM waves.
5 And God saw that this RF spectrum was good.
6 Then the Hand of God moved across the Wires in the Busses,
7 And God separated the High from the Low Potentials.
8 And God saw that this Information was good, and in Parity,
9 Such that His Chips had passed Quality Control
```

## Book of TeXoDuS
* Thou shalt not suffer the 'new' and 'throw' operators to lie in one 
callstack as with Functions, nay, except, verily, when thou construct'st 
an exception in thy 'catch' block, but for that exception shalt not erase 
the information contain'd in that which the block did'st catch
* Thou shalt not throw exceptions with abandon. Reckon the nature of the 'throw' 
operation, for it is a 'goto' operation that yea, do'st unwind thy stack, but 
knowest thou not the number of frames that were yet unwound and the fate of 
thine own instruction pointer, thus no longer moe't there be a deterministic 
execution context whence thy exception thou dids't throw!
* Thou shalt keep holy the weekend, and patcheth not on Monday or Friday, or
thou wilt suffer a great wailing and gnashing of teeth as thou work'st all
weekend, yea verily through Monday, until Tuesday cometh, and thy co-worker
thou need'st to fix thy unholy patch from vacation do'st return!
* Thou shalt patch on Tuesday, and at the hour that thy traffic reacheth
its ebb. Let Tuesday be known throughout the lands as the Day of Holiest Patching,
wherefore, it is the day whence to the office from long weekend vacations and
government holidays thy coworkers returneth in whole, and that thy reward shall
be that thou wilt be provided four whole days in which to patcheth thy patch
should'st thy servers crasheth, and burn'th in the Lake of Fire, yea, justly as
Holy Retribution for the Sins of thy Management!
