What it sounds like. More to come (always, not stopping at 10). In the vein of the [stolen by] King James Bible.

* Thou shalt not suffer the 'new' and 'throw' operators to lie in one callstack as with Functions, nay, except, verily, when thou construct'st an exception in thy 'catch' block, but for that exception shalt not erase the information contain'd in that which the block did'st catch
* Thou shalt not throw exceptions with abandon. Reckon the nature of the 'throw' operation, for it is a 'goto' operation that yea, do'st unwind thy stack, but knowest thou not the number of frames that were yet unwound and the fate of thine own instruction pointer, thus no longer moe't there be a deterministic execution context whence thy exception thou dids't throw!
* Thou shalt keep holy the weekend, and patcheth not on Monday or Friday, or thou shalt suffer a great wailing and gnashing of teeth as thou work'st all weekend, yea verily through Monday, until Tuesday cometh, and thy co-worker thou need'st to fix thy unholy patch do'st return from vacation
* Thou shalt endeavour to patch on Tuesday, and at the hour thy traffic reacheth its ebb. Let Tuesday be known throughout the lands as the Day of Holiest Patching, wherefore, it is the day whence to the office from long weekend vacations and government holidays thy coworkers returneth in whole, and that thy reward shall be that thou would'st still be provided four whole days should thou patcheth thy patch
