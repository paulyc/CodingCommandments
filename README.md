What it sounds like. More to come (always, not stopping at 10)

* Thou shalt not suffer the 'new' and 'throw' operators to lieth in one callstack as with Functions
* Thou shalt keepeth holy the weekend, and not patcheth on the days immediately 'fore and after, or thou shall suffer a great wailing and gnashing of teeth as thou work'st all weekend, yea verily through Monday, until Tuesday cometh and the man or woman thou need'st to fixeth thy unholy patch dost returneth from vacation
* Thou shalt patcheth on Tuesday morning, for it is the day everyone returneth from vacation and Federal holidays, and thou shall still have four days to patcheth thy patch
