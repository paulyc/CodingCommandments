What it sounds like. More to come (always, not stopping at 10). In the vein of the [stolen by] King James Bible.

* Thou shalt not suffer the 'new' and 'throw' operators to lieth in one callstack as with Functions, nay, except, verily, to construct an exception in thy 'catch' block, but for that exception shall not eraseth that which the block did catch
* Thou shalt not throw exceptions with abandon. Reckon the nature of the 'throw' operation, for it is a 'goto' operation that yea, do'th unwind thy stack, but knowest thou not the number of frames that were yet unwound and the fate of thine own instruction pointer, thus no longer moe't there be a deterministic execution state whence thy exception thou dids't throw!
* Thou shalt keep holy the weekend, and patcheth not on Monday or Friday, or thou shalt suffer a great wailing and gnashing of teeth as thou work'st all weekend, yea verily through Monday, until Tuesday cometh, and thy co-worker thou need'st to fixeth thy unholy patch do'st return from vacation
* Thou shalt patch on Tuesday morning, for it is the day everyone returneth from vacation and Federal holidays, and thy reward shalt be that thou would'st still be provided four whole days to patcheth thy patch
