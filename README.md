What it sounds like. More to come (always, not stopping at 10)

* Thou shalt not suffer the 'new' and 'throw' operators to lieth in one callstack as with Functions, except, verily, to construct an exception in thy 'catch' block, but for that exception shall not eraseth that which the block caught'st
* Thou shalt keepeth holy the weekend, and patcheth not on the days immediately 'fore and after, or thou would'st suffer a great wailing and gnashing of teeth as thou work'st all weekend, yea verily through Monday, until Tuesday cometh and the man or woman thou need'st to fixeth thy unholy patch do'st return'th from vacation
* Thou shalt patcheth on Tuesday morning, for it is the day everyone returneth from vacation and Federal holidays, and thy reward shall be that thou would'st still be permitted four whole days to patcheth thy patch
